<P STYLE= "text-align:center">Both teams have their unique school traditions and mascots. 
The University of Georgia dawns the colors red and black, and have a Bulldog as their mascot. 
While Georgia Tech dawns the inferior colors gold and white, and have a whimpy Yellow Jacket
as their mascot. Hate for the opposing team is strongly ingrained in the traditions and fight 
songs of each team. Georgia students commonly refer to Tech students as nerds, dorks, or Techies, while 
tech refers to Georgia students as rednecks, and mocks them in almost all of their fight songs.
Georgia dosent mock Teck in their fight songs because, UGA is a classier university and sees
Tech as being less important. </P>
